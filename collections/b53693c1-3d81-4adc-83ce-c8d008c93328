    "description": "The state of Alabama historically supported North America’s most diverse invertebrate fauna. This diversity is most notable among the freshwater and terrestrial Mollusca. Approximately 200 of the 300 known species of North American freshwater mussels have been reported from the waters of Alabama, and these systems once supported nearly 250 species of aquatic snails. Additionally, there are 85 species of crayfish in Alabama, the highest of any state in the US. Unfortunately, this spectacular biodiversity has been severely compromised by human activities. Modification of large river systems has resulted in substantial habitat loss, and many aquatic species now have highly fragmented distributions.In 1999 we began to accumulate material from Alabama’s populations of mollusks and other aquatic invertebrates.",
