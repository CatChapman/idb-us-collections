  "description": "The Colorado College Arthropod Collection (COCOA) is one of four biodiversity collections housed in the Department of Organismal Biology & Ecology at Colorado College. This small collection is comprised of about 170 drawers of pinned insects and miscellaneous material in ethanol. Although the holdings are varied, the geographic focus is mostly Colorado, the Rocky Mountains, and the Southwest. The collection primarily serves as a teaching collection for Colorado College undergraduate students, but also supports student and faculty research projects.",
