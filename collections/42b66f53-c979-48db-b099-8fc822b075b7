    "description": "Our holdings as of April 2015 include 169,014 (54,236 juveniles and adults; 114,778 eggs and larvae) computer-cataloged lots, the oldest dating back to 1862; and 8,348,483 (384,801 juveniles and adults, and 7,963,682 eggs and larvae) computer-cataloged specimens—in all representing 4,034 species in 1,383 genera and 326 families. In addition, we have 300 lots of primary and secondary types, 11,500 frozen tissues representing 815 species and 138 families, and a unique historical collection of salmon scales containing some 800,000 samples taken from six species of anadromous salmonids from across the North Pacific Ocean over a 55-year period. We recently added 2.4 million pairs of otoliths collected throughout the eastern North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea by Alaska Fisheries Science Center (AFSC) personnel and fishery observers over the past 40 years which represents 83 species in 41 genera and 17 families. Among the juveniles and adults, about 85% are marine from the North Pacific Ocean and Bering Sea, with significant smaller collections from the western Pacific from the Marshall and Solomon Islands and the Philippines. About 15% are freshwater from Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Alaska, British Columbia, and California. Our early life history stages cover the entire breadth of the North Pacific, Bering Sea, Gulf of Alaska, and Pacific sector of the Arctic Ocean. We also have a unique collection of freshwater and inshore marine fishes from all 24 of the larger islands of the Russian Kuril Archipelago, including Kamchatka and Sakhalin Island: 59,289 specimens in 1,749 lots, representing 139 species in 86 genera and 22 families.",
