    "description": "The Collection of Fossil Vertebrates represents an integral research and teaching component of the Department of Geology and Geophysics. The collection is a nationally recognized, public scientific resource that emphasizes the late Mesozoic and Cenozoic fossil record of Wyoming's Laramide basins and High Plains. The collection has roots that extend back to 1887, when The University of Wyoming's Geological Museum was founded; it was led by early curators William H. Reed and Wilbur C. Knight. Since then, the collection has grown into one of the most important for research on the geological and biological history of the Rocky Mountain region.",
