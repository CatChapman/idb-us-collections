    "description": "The Museum of Marine Invertebrates and Molluscs at Northern Arizona University is a teaching and research collection of preserved, dried, and mounted specimens. This collection was originally established by Stanley A. Wilkes in the early 1970s and has been maintained by Stephen M. Shuster since 1990. Specimens from the northern Gulf of California and the western coast of North America form the core of the collection. However, specimens from eastern North America, the Caribbean Sea, the tropical Pacific islands, and the southwestern United States are also well represented in the collection. In 2010, more than 600 marine and freshwater mollusc shells, which made up the Lois Richards Shell Collection, were added to the museum. The total collection now includes nearly 6,000 specimens.",
