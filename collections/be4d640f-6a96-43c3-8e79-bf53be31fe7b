    "description": "The LACM Rancho La Brea collections hold 3-5 million fossil specimens covering ~50,000 years to near present day. They hold the world's largest collection of extinct megafauna and are particularly well known for the vast osteological collections of carnivores and birds. In addition, the collections include botany, arthropods, mollusca and small vertebrates, including fishes, amphibia, reptilia and mammals as well as artifacts. The collections are all from the vicinity of the Rancho La Brea National Natural Landmark, mostly within the Los Angeles County park called Hancock Park. ",
