  "description": "The NSU herbarium contains approximately 3000 full sheet specimens primarily collected across the state of South Dakota by students and faculty yearly. Acquired collections from Cornell and Harvard are also housed at the herbarium along with specimens from Mexico, Arizona, Oregon, Alaska, and more states across the U.S. Collection dates span as far back as the 1800's. The NSU herbarium also contains a collection of small specimens: individually pressed flowers and leaves in envelopes which are estimated to number 1000-2000. The collection is focused on Angiosperms from all families but also contains several pteridophytes and gymnosperms. Bryophytes and Lycophytes are alcohol preserved. The collection also contains a few dried fungi in addition to a small seed collection.",
