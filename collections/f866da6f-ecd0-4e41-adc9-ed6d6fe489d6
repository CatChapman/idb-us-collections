    "description": "MNA houses an extensive regional collection of invertebrates from northern Arizona and the southern Colorado Plateau, including major collections (many from Native American Tribal lands), many first records of species from the southern Colorado Plateau, a large number of species new to science, and a growing number of type specimens. In all, MNA houses more than 300,000 invertebrate specimens. A total of 79,253 specimens have been databased, including 4,899 species in 1,655 genera among 409 families in 67 orders or higher taxa. The collection features extensive or complete collections of the spiders, butterflies, dragonflies, grasshoppers, and aculeate Hymenoptera (bees, ants and wasps) of the southern Colorado Plateau. In many cases the MNA holdings are the only complete collections of those taxa from the region. For example, the MNA collection contains 30 tiger beetle taxa from the southern Colorado Plateau, of which nearly one quarter are endemic (unique) to the region.  Also, of the nearly 150 butterfly taxa represented from the southern Plateau in the MNA collections, at least 7 (5%) are endemic. More than 20 (10.5%) of the 191 robber fly species in the MNA database may be new to science.",
