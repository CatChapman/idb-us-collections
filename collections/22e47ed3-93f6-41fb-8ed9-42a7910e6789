    "description": "Invertebrate Zoology conducts research, research training and graduate education on the world’s invertebrates – their global diversity, evolution, geography, genomics, morphology, conservation, ecology and behavior. These studies are grounded in research collections of hundreds of specimens and their associated data. As of November 2009, the Invertebrate Zoology Collection at the KU Biodiversity Institute contains more than 2000 lots, including more than 150 lots of type specimens. A strength (with more than 1500 lots) is \"sea anemones\" (Cnidaria: Anthozoa: Actiniaria, Zoanthidea, and Corallimorpharia)",
