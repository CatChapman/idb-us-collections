    "description": "Significant holdings include Coleoptera (beetles), Hemiptera (true bugs), Lepidoptera (butterflies and moths), and Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Over 80% of these specimens are identified to the species-level. Hymenoptera (ants, wasps, and bees) are also well represented, but their identification levels vary considerably from family to family. Five hundred thousand specimens of arachnids, crustaceans, termites, ants, and insect larvae are preserved in alcohol. The slide collection includes preparations of over 25,000 mites, 300 thrips, and sizable collections of mosquitos and ant larvae. The geographic scope of the collection covers all of the southwestern US with special concentration on the Sonoran Desert Region and adjacent tropical biomes of northwestern Mexico. The footprint of the Sonoran Desert Region circumscribes many non-desert areas with rich geologic histories that provide the physical framework for past vicariance and speciation events for many arthropod lineages. A great variety of natural habitats occur here, including coastal and inland sand dunes, dry deserts, thornscrub, tropical deciduous forest, riparian corridors, and upland habitats that include the southern Colorado Plateau and the Sky Islands, with a vertical succession of biomes from desert scrub to montane forest and subalpine conifer forest.",
