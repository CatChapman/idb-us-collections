    "description": "In addition to extensive collections of central Illinois prairies and woodlands dating to the middle 1800s, the herbarium has many collections from the mountains of western United States and from California.  The historically most important specimens were collected by George Vasey who accompanied John Wesley Powell on his geological expeditions exploring the Colorado Rocky Mountains (Lat. 40-41 N) area in 1868.   These specimens represent the earliest scientific collections from this area.  The herbarium also contains exchange specimens from Europe dating to the early 1800s.",
