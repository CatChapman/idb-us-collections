    "description": "The Lake Forest College Herbarium is home to more than 3,700 plant specimens dating from the turn of the twentieth century, with some being collected, purportedly, as early as 1848. Between the years 1895 and 1897, M.C. Jensen, a student and botanist, collected more than 70 specimens within the city of Lake Forest, IL, and added these to the Collegeâ€™s collection.\n\nDr. Elizabeth Teter Lunn, a Professor of Biology at the College from 1929 to 1970 assiduously presided over and put together a large portion of our current collection. Dr. Kenneth Weik, Professor of Biology Emeritus, worked with Elizabeth T. Lunn within the biological boundaries of the college. Together they contributed scores of herbaria specimens to this collection.",
