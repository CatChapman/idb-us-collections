    "description": "The Non-Molluscan Invertebrate Collection houses well over 30,000 specimen lots (where a lot contains one to many individuals collected from the same site at the same time) and more than 500 type specimens (the physical specimens to which a taxonomic name is formally assigned). With specimens dating back to the 1870s, the Collection reflects nearly a century and a half of collecting in freshwater, terrestrial, and near- and far-shore marine habitats of the Carolinas, Mid-Atlantic Region, and southeastern USA. Holdings of certain taxonomic groups span a much broader, i.e., international, geographic scope. Yet, it is the Non-Molluscan Collection in its entirety that reflects a rich history of scientific collecting and taxonomy, and thus a wealth of opportunities for research, education, and outreach.",
