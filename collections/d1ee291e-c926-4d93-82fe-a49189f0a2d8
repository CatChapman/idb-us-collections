    "description": " Specializing in flora of the north central and eastern plains of Montana. In addition to grass- and shrub lands, we house specimen vouchers from localized mountain areas that rise above the plains (e.g., Sweetgrass Hills, Bears Paw and Little Belt Mountains). Plants collected from prairie potholes and limestone outcrops, as well as those from cottonwood dominated riparian areas and gumbo bluffs associated with the Missouri River Breaks, are included in the collection. Voucher age ranges from the early 1900’s to the present and some of these represent plants collected from more well-known regions, e.g., Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, and Glacier National Parks.",
