    "description": "Started in 1903, the PADA collection has been primarily an agricultural collection.  Early collections focused on basic Pennsylvania flora as well as a wide breath of agricultural pests.  A large collection of Riker mounts was created at this time.  This focus continued until the 1940s and 1950s when acquisitions declined.  Collections increased in the 1960s and 1970s.  Recent collections have focused primarily on pests of hardwoods, namely Cerambycidae, Bupretidae, and Curculionidae: Scolytinae.",
