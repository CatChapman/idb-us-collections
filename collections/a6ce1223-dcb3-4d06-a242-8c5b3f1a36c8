  "description": "In 1914 the herbarium of St. Ambrose University was established as an addition to the biology department by Monsignor Ulrich A. Hauber. The herbarium currently holds over 900 of Hauber’s collections that were among the first specimens added to the facility and just over half of his collections were from the Quad Cities area. Today’s herbarium holds approximately 4500 specimens and, though it includes bryophytes, pteridophytes, gymnosperms, and fungi, flowering plants comprise nearly 90% of the total.",
