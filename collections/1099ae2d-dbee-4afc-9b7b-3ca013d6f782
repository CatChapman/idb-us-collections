    "description": "The Chicago Academy of Sciences herpetology collection includes over 22,000 specimens, primarily preserved in alcohol. Approximately 60% of the specimens are reptiles and 40% are amphibians. The Midwest is strongly represented, as are Arizona and southeastern United States, thanks to multiple Academy expeditions during the mid-1900s. The collection contains many para- and holotypes, as well as one subspecies type specimen, of the Northern Crawfish Frog (Lithobates areolata circulosa). Notable collectors include: Knox Conant, Hudson Conant, Richard A. Edgren, Howard K. Gloyd, R. L. Hutchison, Betty Komarek, Edwin V. Komarek, Roy V. Komarek, Walter L. Necker, and Orlando Park.",
